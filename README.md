# Custom Student Management System (PHP + MySQL)

## 📌 Introduction
The **Custom Student Management System** is a web-based application built using **PHP** and **MySQL** to manage student records efficiently.  
It allows administrators to add, update, delete, and view student information, reducing paperwork and ensuring data accuracy.

This project was developed as part of my academic work to demonstrate backend development, database management, and CRUD functionality.
